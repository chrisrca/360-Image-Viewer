# 360 Image Viewer

360 Image Viewer is a viewer for 360 images that uses threejs. The project also contains python scripts allowing developers to paint "hotspots" onto the image which can be used on the 360 image. By converting the uv location to a vector3 location, the position of the hotspot on the screen can be calculated, allowing interactive html to be rendered "in" the 3d space.
